Spotify Playlist Analysis

A work-in-progress Machine Learning analysis of Spotify's song features data for my PopConnoisseur Spotify playlist and the Billboard Hot 100 using Spotipy, Pandas, Seaborn, Tensorflow and Scikit-learn. My objectives are two-fold:

1) Explore the data to test if Spotify's data are reasonably accurate to what I know about the songs themselves (hint: mostly they are), and if there are data quality issues (hint: there are).
2) Do some machine learning prediction to see how well it categorizes the tracks according to their features.

I use the packages Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit and Tensorflow

get_playlists.py - to get song features from a Spotify playlist using the SpotiPy package

spotify_playlist_analysis.ipynb - an exploration of the song features data and its formatting followed by some machine learning predictions, with what is hopefully clear explanation interspersed throughout.

If you have any questions or comments or want to contribute, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
