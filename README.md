Spotify Playlist Analysis

A work-in-progress Machine Learning analysis of Spotify's song features data for my PopConnoisseur Spotify playlist and the Billboard Hot 100 using Spotipy, Pandas, Seaborn, Tensorflow and Scikit-learn. My objectives are two-fold:

1) Explore the data to test if Spotify's data are reasonably accurate to what I know about the songs themselves, or if there are data quality issues. (Hint: they are)
2) Do some machine learning prediction to see how well it categorizes the tracks according to their features.

There are a lot of files here, and a fair amount of overlap. I'd recommend starting with two_playlist_data_analysis_combined.ipynb. It has some basic exploration of the data's formatting followed by some machine learning predictions, with what is hopefully clear explanation interspersed throughout.

I use the packages Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit and Tensorflow
