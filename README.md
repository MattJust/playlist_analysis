Spotify Playlist Analysis

A work-in-progress Machine Learning analysis of my PopConnoisseur Spotify playlist and the Billboard Hot 100 using Spotipy, Pandas, Seaborn, Tensorflow and Scikit-learn.

There are a lot of files here, and a fair amount of overlap. I'd recommend starting with two_playlist_data_analysis_combined.ipynb. It's a one-stop-shop, with some hopefully clear explanation interspersed.

If you have any questions or comments or want to contribute, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
