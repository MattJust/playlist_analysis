Spotify Playlist Analysis

A Machine Learning analysis of Spotify's song features data for my PopConnoisseur Spotify playlist and the Billboard Hot 100 using Spotipy, Pandas, Seaborn, Tensorflow and Scikit-learn. My objectives are two-fold:

1) Explore the data to test if Spotify's data are reasonably accurate to what I know about the songs themselves (hint: mostly they are), and if there are data quality issues (hint: there are).
2) Do some machine learning prediction to see how well it categorizes the tracks according to their features (hint: reasonably well).

If you have any questions or comments or want to contribute, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
